Extremely simple to use character counter for Chrome

## OwO whats this?
A Chrome extension for counting characters.  
This extension is very minimalistic as all it does is that it stays in the toolbar and keeps displaying character count whenever you select something in the page. How cute  

### A small story behind the project
I felt like Im counting characters quite often when studying, so I decided to make it efficient by making this extension.  
Also this is my first work on browser extensions. Feel free to open issues or pull requests!
